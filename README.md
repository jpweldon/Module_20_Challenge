# Module_20_Challenge

# Joint Savings Account Solidity Smart Contract

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is that I have been recently hired by a fintech startup company. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I will create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

Clone the Module_20_Challenge repository from GitHub:

'git clone https://github.com/jpweldon/Module_20_Challenge.git'

Review joint_savings.sol and the images in the Execution_Results folder.

Open the joint_savings.sol file in the Remix IDE at (https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js).

Compile the smart contract.

Navigate to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” pane, and then make sure that “JavaScript VM” is selected as the environment.

Click the Deploy button to deploy the smart contract.
